# Generator
A simple pseudo-random number generator and coin flip simulator for when you are not sure about making a decision. It is not truly random and does have some technical bias which is almost impossible to avoid but it shouldn't matter unless you are a "perfectionist". The source code for the application is open to everyone. For more information check out the license file. Feedback is much appreciated.

Cheers!
